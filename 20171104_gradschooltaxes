I recently received my PhD from the Genome Sciences department at the University of Washington and am now a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biology Department at the University of Utah. Most graduate students are paid a stipend, generally between $25,000 and $45,000 per year, which even at elite universities is slightly above a living wage in their area. We benefit greatly from the Lifetime Learning Credit and untaxed tuition waivers (which can cost upwards of $50,000 - $60,000 per year). These tax benefits are rescinded in the current version of the Republican tax bill, and I implore you to vote against them, as they will put undue economic stress upon an already stressed population, potentially decimating graduate education in the United States. Compounding these changes with taxation of student loans will have a direct effect -- only financially stable students will be able to attend graduate school. Graduate programs (and therefore, the research community in the United States) thrive on diversity, and removing poor and underrepresented students from that pool will have drastic consequences.
